**Abstract**: Eye tracking is a computer vision technique widely used in many fields especially in a medical field. This paper introduced the new eye tracking method based on gradient orientation pattern matching and automatic template update technique. This proposed method can be implemented in real-time application and can provide high robustness to changing lighting condition during tracking process.

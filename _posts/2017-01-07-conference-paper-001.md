**Abstract**: This paper describes a comparison between newly introduced a gradient orientation pattern template matching method (GOPM) and the traditional template matching method in real-time implementation. These techniques are aimed at real-time eye tracking for assisting the ophthalmologist to perform eye treatment and surgery. GOPM is a technique of template matching that use normalized gradient information of image as inputs for matching instead of intensity information as used in traditional block template matching. A strength of GOPM over traditional block matching is that GOPM provides a robustness to changing lighting condition. GOPM can perform template matching very well during the lighting condition changes, whereas the traditional method fail to achieve the best matching position. Moreover, both GOPM and traditional method required small computation time so both methods can be implemented to real-time applications.

I would like to announce the completion of my PhD study.
I’ve officially obtained the PhD degree in Electrical Engineering for my thesis
titled “[Compressed sensing for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data](http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/15704/)“.

I would like to thank [Prof. Pier Luigi Dragotti](http://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~pld/) and [Dr. Lyudmila Mihaylova](https://www.shef.ac.uk/acse/staff/lsm/index) for
conducting my oral examination (viva voce). Also I would like to thank
[Dr. Charith Abhayaratne](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/eee/staff/c_abhayaratne), my supervisor, for his supports throughout my study.

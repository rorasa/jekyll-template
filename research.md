## Evaluation of Sensing and Computer Vision Techniques for Recycling Industry
![](http://via.placeholder.com/300){:.float-left}

Recycling industry is one of the most challenging applications for
computer vision techniques. Unlike other popular applications such as face
recognition, the environment of the recycling plant and the characteristic
of the recyclable objects are extremely hard to define. This project addressed
a set of particular vital challenges for the current recycling technologies.

This project has finished in 2016.

## Compressed Sensing for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)

Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a popular non-invasive tool for the
study of brain activity. By incorporating the compressed sensing, a novel signal
processing technique, the performance of the fMRI can be vastly improved.

This project has finished in 2016

## Automatic Eye Tracking for Eye Surgery Microscope

Manual microscope control has always been inconvenient whenever an
ophthalmologist has to perform the eye surgery. This project proposes a novel
eye tracking technique designed especially for incorporating into the autonomous
microscope, providing the ability to track and follow the movement of the
subjectâ€™s eye without the input of the ophthalmologist.

This project has finished in 2010.
